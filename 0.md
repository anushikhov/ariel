@INC is a built-in array perl provides. It contains a series of directories, the "search path" for perl when trying to load a module.  

When perl encounters a __use__ statement, a __require__ statement, or a __do__ statement, it will go over the directories listed in @INC and check if the appropriate file can be found.  

The content of @INC is baked into the perl version and differs based on the version and OS it is installed on.  

It can be changed through __PERLLIB__ and __PERL5LIB__ envars using the `-l` command line flag, or inside the code by manipulating @INC directly.
